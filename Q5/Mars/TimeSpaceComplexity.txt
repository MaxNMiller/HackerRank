Time Complexity: The program has two nested loops. The outer one iterates s.length()/3 times, and the inner loop iterates 3 times. Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(n/3 Ã— 3)*, which simplifies to O(n)*.

Space Complexity: The space complexity is constant, O(1), as it does not depend on the size of the input string s.

*Note: n = s.length()
