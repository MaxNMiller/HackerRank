The time complexity of 'hackerrankInString' is O(n), where n is the length of input string `s`.  
Since The function uses a loop that iterates over each character in the string, we can reason that the time complexity must scale linearly with the size of the input. 
The space complexity of the function is also O(n). By turning the input string `s` into `chararray` we create a new array that is proportional to the length of `s`. 
This results in linear space complexity.
