Time Complexity:
As this is an implementation of Insertion Sort we already know it has an average and worst-case time complexity of O(n^2), where n is the number of elements in the list. The modifications to count the number of sorts don't
change the overall time complexity because this change only adds constant time operations.

Space Complexity:
The space complexity of the Insertion Sort is O(1) because it uses a constant amount of extra space for variables regardless of the size of the input list.
