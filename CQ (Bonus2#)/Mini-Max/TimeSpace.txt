The complexity of 'miniMaxSum' is O(n log n). While The conversion of integers to long values, the summing operations, 
and the print operation are all linear, 'Collections.sort' has an average time complexity of O(n log n) because it is an implementation of QuickSort.
The space complexity of the function is O(n), since the program creates a new list (longarr) which takes up approximately the same amount of space 
as the original list (arr). Since the other variables (mini, max) don't scale with n, they aren't factored into the overall space complexity.


Note that n in this context represents the size of the input list*
