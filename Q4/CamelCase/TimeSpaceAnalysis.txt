Time Analysis:
- The function uses a for-each loop to iterate through each character in the string. This process has a time complexity of O(n).
- Within the loop, each character is checked with the Character.isUpperCase() method, which runs in constant time O(1).
- Since the program only does constant-time operations for each character, the overall time complexity of the function is O(n).

Space Analysis:
 The space complexity of the 'count' variable is constant O(1). However, storing the string as a char array takes O(n). Overall, the space complexity of the program is O(n)
